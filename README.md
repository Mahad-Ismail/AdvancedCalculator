Smart Advanced Calculator & Multi-Function Graph




Overview

This project is a fully offline, single-file HTML web application that combines:

A scientific calculator with advanced AI-powered input suggestions.

Multi-function interactive graph plotting with legends and color-coded functions.

Word problem solver with physics, algebra, percentages, and unit conversions.

Dark/Light mode for better usability.

Animated starry background for a visually engaging experience.


All features are designed for speed, efficiency, and usability in a single HTML file, making it easy to deploy or share.

Features

1. Scientific Calculator

Supports trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) in degrees.

Supports logarithms, powers, square roots, and constants (π, e).

AI-like suggestions:

Suggests functions, constants, operators, and closing parentheses.

Clickable suggestions for auto-completion.


History:

Last 5 calculations saved for reuse.


Fully interactive numeric keypad with clickable keys.


2. Multi-Function Graphing

Supports multiple functions simultaneously (e.g., sin(x), x^2, cos(x)).

Each function is color-coded automatically.

Includes on-canvas legend for easy identification.

Interactive pan & zoom.

Dynamic axes with ticks.


3. Word Problem Solver & Unit Conversion

Auto-detects:

Physics (e.g., distance = speed × time)

Algebra (sum of numbers)

Percentages


Unit conversion examples:

Meters ↔ Kilometers

Seconds ↔ Minutes


Provides clear result display.


4. UI Enhancements

Dark/Light mode toggle.

Animated starry background for immersive visual appeal.

Fully responsive layout.

Works entirely offline, no external dependencies.

Usage

1. Open the HTML file in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).


2. Use the calculator:

Type an expression or use clickable keys.

Watch AI suggestions appear for auto-completion.

Click Calculate to get results.



3. Use the graphing tool:

Enter one or more functions separated by commas (e.g., sin(x), x^2).

Click Plot Graph.

Pan and zoom using mouse drag and scroll.



4. Use the word problem/units tool:

Enter a problem in the textarea.

Select unit conversion if needed.

Click Solve to see results.

Example Expressions

sin(30)+cos(60) → Trigonometric calculation

log(100)+√(16) → Logarithms & roots

2^3 + 5 → Powers

sin(x), x^2, cos(x) → Graph multiple functions
